# Generative-Misogyny
Art piece that presents sexist statements about female politicians in an abstract and visually aesthetic manner.

All the comments shown are actual quotes from news stories and media outlets. The words display straight for 5 minutes, then a multiple random words are chosen that will disappear from the text displayed. This makes for new kinds of sentences, some of which remain discriminatory, and some of which appear to be nonsense. The goal is to make the viewer think about the kinds of words people use about female leaders and elicit a reaction to seeing the judgemental statements used about them.
